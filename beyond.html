            <p>
                This is a routine board made for children with adhd to create an effective bedtime routine so that both children and parents will sleep better.

                <p>
                    This is a team project for sleep. For this project we needed to design a screen free interactive products that help create an effective bed time routine for a target group. We were allowed to choose our own group so we chose young children with adhd.

                    RESEARCH
                </h2>

                <p>
                    To visualize who our target group is we used a few techniques: we started with doing deskresearch and doing a few interviews
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It's very important for children to have a fixed sleeping schedule </li>
                    <li>All the children we interviewed preferred to sleep with a nightlight</li>
                    <li>Sleep rituals like reading time help with falling asleep faster</li>
                    <li>Fixed routines help with regulating the sleep drive which is very important for children</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Having a persona and context map helps us visualize our target group and so we have a deeper understanding of how our persona sleeps at night and the problems they deal with. This way we have a reference point to work with.

            <p>From here we wrote down all the functions and used a morfological chart to see in which ways we could implement it. From there we made a sketch for our lo-fi prototype </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/routinebord2.jpg" alt="">

                <p>This is our lo-fi prototype:<br>
    
                    This board is divided into 2 parts: a morning routine and an evening routine. The day starts with a good morning from our character 'Puk', so you then go through your routine with him. We chose a fox instead of a human so that this can be inclusive for all types of children. The intention is to have many different types of these cards so that children have the freedom to create their own routine, because everyone has a different routine! <br><br>

                    Many children still need a night light because they are afraid of the dark. So we have another projector that will be placed at the top of the board. You can operate this light with a push button.<br><br> 

                    Finally, we also have speakers on the side, but we have not yet incorporated them into this prototype due to lack of time. Children can also play music quietly in the evening so that they can relax.

                    We were able to test this prototype with our peers. We did 5 rounds with two people every round. We wanted to test if users were able to understand how it works and if there were any confusions.
