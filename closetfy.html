                <p>
                    For the project responsive multi device design I was given the assignment to come up with an interactive experience that can be experienced with multiple devices. In this specific project the idea was to focus on 1 specific experience with 1 specific outcome on a fictional platform. 

                    It was important to take the context of the user into account.

                    <p> 
                        Nina needs a new outfit for a party tonight, so she doesn't have enough time to go to many stores to find the perfect outfit. Now she's afraid that she won't be able to find an outfit in time. She remembers that there is an app where you can try on clothes virtually. After uploading a photo of herself, she chooses a number of dresses. However, she is still a bit unsure about which dress looks best on her, so she wants to try them on in the store to be sure. In the app, she chooses to reserve the dresses in the store.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She quickly goes to the store and luckily can pick up her dresses at a pick-up point with the help of a QR code. She can now try on her dresses and then choose the best dress.
                    </p>

                    <p>                        
                        Afterwards, Nina shares her new dress with her friends and the code of the dress in case her friends also want to try on/pick up this dress. And is very happy that she was able to find a nice dress in time for the party.
