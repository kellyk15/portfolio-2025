                    This is my project for the class visual interface design. For this project it was important to that users could email themselves their book list and that elements of the government identity  were visible while developing an style that attracts junior high school students.

            <h2>lo-fi</h2>
            <p>I started with making the lo-fi prototype in Figma. This way i had an overview of all the screens while not having to focus too much on all the details.</p>

            <div>
                <article>
                    <h3>choice screen</h3>
                    <img src="images/lofi1.png" alt="">
                    <p>During this process we had to focus on the one primary action to make ensure users could follow the right flow.  So for the choice screens i framed the primary action while keeping the secondary actions outside of the frame but still have a structured overview.</p>
                </article>
                
                <article>
                    <h3>results</h3>
                    <img src="images/lofi2.png" alt="">
                    <p>For the results i tried to give the users an overview of the books that are recommended for them without overwhelming them but too many options, but the description was too small and it was a little confusing.</p>
                </article>
    
                <article>
                    <h3>wishlist</h3>
                    <img src="images/lofi3.png" alt="">
                    <p>This is the wishlist. It's very simple but i think its more effective that way. </p>
                </article>
    
                <article>
                    <h3>hi-fi variations</h3>
                    <img src="images/finder-variaties.png" alt="">
                    <p>Part of the assignment was that we also start with a few hi-fi variations. And see which layout works best, but i ended up with a totally different design.</p>
                </article>
            </div>
        
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>hi-fi</h2>

            <div>
                <article>
                    <h3>choice screen</h3>
                    <img src="images/hifi1.png" alt="">
                    <p>For the hi-fi i still chose to keep the primary action within a frame. I chose for an organic form so it looks more playful while choosing more muted colours. That way it wouldn't be too overwhelming for users. </p>
                </article>
                
                <article>
                    <h3>results</h3>
                    <img src="images/hifi2.png" alt="">
                    <p>I changed the results to be more like the wishlist. This way its more consistent and i added a searchbar and added a dropdown menu for sorting.</p>
                </article>
    
                <article>
                    <h3>wishlist</h3>
                    <img src="images/hifi3.png" alt="">
                    <p>The wishlist mostly stayed the same. but i did change the progress bar to dots so that way users are able to see where they are in the process.</p>
